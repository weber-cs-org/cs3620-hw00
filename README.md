# Homework 01 Initial Setup and Prime Numbers

## First Name, Last Name

### Initial Setup

* Install `git` on your development box.
  * OSX example: `brew install git`
* Install `php8` on your development box.
  * OSX example: `brew install php`
* Install `composer` dependency manager on your development box.
  * OSX example: `brew install composer`
* Run `composer install`

### Problem Statement

Write a function which finds the n<sup>th</sup> prime number between 0 and 10,000. For simplicity, we assume that the input will always be an integer(int). If the input is smaller than or equal to 0, the function should throw an appropriate exception.

### Files to work on

* `src/PrimeNumber.php` Implement the necessary function(s) there.

### Notes

* What is a prime number? [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number)
* In our problem, we consider 2 is the first prime number.
* The initial code will **not necessarily** compile. You will have to write the necessary code.
* It is recommended that you add your name and travis ci badge to the README.md file.
* Make sure your last push is before the deadline. Your last push will be considered as your final submission.
* If you need to be considered for partial grade for any reason (failing tests on travis, etc...). Then email me **before** the deadline. Late email requests will not be considered.
* Post questions on Canvas.
